## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

  One challenged I faced while building this app is trying to connect the UI to logic. I didn't realize you can hold down the
  control button to create a literal line which directs you to where you want the UI to go/connect to

## New App Idea

  I was thinking an app thats used for cooking/baking/meal prep would be nice. When you start up the app, the first thing its going to
  ask is what nationality of food you want to focus on and depending on the user's response it will then give you a list of 
  categories. For example, if you want to focus on Mexican food, the next page will then give you a list of different types of Mexican
  foods such as tacos, burritos, etc. People are also able to provide their receipes for everyone to see and try out!
